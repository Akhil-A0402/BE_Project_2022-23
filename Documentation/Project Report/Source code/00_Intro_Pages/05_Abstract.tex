Many employees from different locations join the meeting, so the issue of the language barrier comes in to resolve this issue a translator is used, but information about the company is confidential. A key tool for addressing this issue is Translation as a Service. The main function of Translation as a Service is to automatically translate the personâ€™s speech into the desired language. Neural Machine Translation is the algorithm used in this model. The goal of Neural Machine Translation is to take a sentence in one language as input and return the sentence translated into a different language. After using the Translation as a Service model employees can translate real-time meetings which will help in reducing the language barrier.
